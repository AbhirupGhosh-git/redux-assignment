1. Apply Thunk middleware - allowsa an action creator to return a function instead of an action.
2. Function now can perform side effects such as fetching data. The function also can dispatch regular actions based on the response.
3. These actions then will be handled by the reducer which updates the redux state.
4. When the state is updated the component which has subscribed to the state changes will receive the updated state which then can be used in JSX.
